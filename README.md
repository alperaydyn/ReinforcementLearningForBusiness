# ReinforcementLearningForBusiness

This repo is to provide a framework for businesses to apply reinforcement learning based solutions

There are various libraries and frameworks for Reinforcement Learning, but most require advanced knowledge. This framework will provide drag-and-drop based simple steps to set up a business environment and train RL models in this environment.

There will be ready to use datasets included to the library to enable a demonstration of the framework and give an insight on how this library can be used in differen kinds of business problems, most are tabular historic data.

Possible problems may include;
* RL based recommendation engine
* RL based pricing
* RL based customer prioritization

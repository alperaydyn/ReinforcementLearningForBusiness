## Problem: 
Imagine that you are the manager of a call center and you are responsible for assigning incoming calls to your team of customer service representatives (CSRs). Each CSR has a different level of experience, and you want to ensure that each call is assigned to the best available CSR to optimize customer satisfaction.

## Solution with Reinforcement Learning: 
You can use RL to build an agent that learns how to assign calls to CSRs over time. The agent will take as input the characteristics of each incoming call (e.g., the topic of the call, the urgency of the request, the language required) and the experience level of each available CSR. It will output the index of the best CSR to assign the call to, based on the expected reward (e.g., customer satisfaction rating) of each possible action.
